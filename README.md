# Red Prism

Project is aimed to be an information junkie's best friend. Think [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) on steroids.

## Planned Features

* Aggregate information from multiple sources (RSS, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Email, etc)
* Show collected information in real time, groupped and filtered by your own criteria
* Seamless integration with popular social networks to easily share your findings

## Usage

Dev version is currently available at http://vast-cove-2324.herokuapp.com/, but don't expect much for now.
